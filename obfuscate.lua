Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice. - Wayne Dyer","The essential lesson I've learned in life is to just be yourself. Treasure the magnificent being that you are and recognize first and foremost you're not here as a human being only. You're a spiritual being having a human experience. - Wayne Dyer","It makes no sense to worry about things you have no control over because there's nothing you can do about them, and why worry about things you do control? The activity of worrying keeps you immobilized. - Wayne Dyer","Give yourself a gift of five minutes of contemplation in awe of everything you see around you. Go outside and turn your attention to the many miracles around you. This five-minute-a-day regimen of appreciation and gratitude will help you to focus your life in awe. - Wayne Dyer","You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with. - Wayne Dyer","You can either be a host to God, or a hostage to your ego. It's your call. - Wayne Dyer","Go for it now. The future is promised to no one. - Wayne Dyer","When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It's to enjoy each step along the way. - Wayne Dyer","Love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you. - Wayne Dyer","The highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about. - Wayne Dyer","When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself. - Wayne Dyer","Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made. - Wayne Dyer","Everything that's created comes out of silence. Your thoughts emerge from the nothingness of silence. Your words come out of this void. Your very essence emerged from emptiness. All creativity requires some stillness. - Wayne Dyer","Conflict cannot survive without your participation. - Wayne Dyer","You cannot always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside. - Wayne Dyer","Abundance is not something we acquire. It is something we tune into. - Wayne Dyer","It's never crowded along the extra mile. - Wayne Dyer"}local d=math.randomseed(os.clock()*9e9)local e="IlIlIl"local f=#e;function GenerateStrings(g)local h={}for i=1,g or 10 do local j=math.random(1,f)local k=string.sub(e,j,j)h[#h+1]=k end;return table.concat(h)end;function RandomQuotes(table)local l=#table;local m=math.random(1,l)local n=0;for o,p in pairs(table)do n=n+1;if n==m then return p end end end;local q=GenerateStrings(14)local r="-- This file was generated using Refuscator v2.1\n\nlocal IlllIlIlIIlIlIl=loadstring;local IllIIllllllIlI=print;local IIIIlllIlIlIl=error;local IllllllllIlIlIIl=string.gsub;"local s="if IlllIlIlIIlIlIl==IllIIllllllIlI or IlllIlIlIIlIlIl==IIIIlllIlIlIl then return end"local t="0"..math.random(1,9e9)local u=tostring(b:gsub(".",function(v)return"\\"..t.."\\"..v:byte().."\\"..t end)or b.."\"")function AddString()r=r.." local "..GenerateStrings(29).." = ("..math.random(1,5254).."+"..math.random(1,5254).."-"..math.random(1,5254).."-"..math.random(1,5254).."+"..math.random(1,5254).."+"..math.random(1,5254)..")
